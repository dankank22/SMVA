   "hey what's up guys mkbhd here fun fact people still use blackberries a recent poll from the boy genius report showed that the current u.s usage share of smartphones for blackberry is one percent it was measured from mobile web data usage which means basically in layman's terms that one percent of all the phones that are going on the internet nowadays are blackberries but how much is that really well there are 300 million people living in the united states and roughly 115 million of those people in 2012 are smartphone owners and we'll call blackberry smartphones for this so one percent of these 115 million smartphone owners are blackberries that means there are 1.15 million people using blackberries today in the united states that's a lot of people now taking a look at this chart it shows that as recently as october 2011 more than five percent of people using smartphones were blackberries so now that's more than a 75 percent drop off in just less than a year but they're still afloat there's still a million of them why so many well you have to consider the fact that a lot of the people who are using blackberries are people who got them because of enterprise that's a huge market that blackberry and rim used to hold most people who are getting jobs that give out phones they give their employees a blackberry to use and if you want to use the phone for personal use you can buy another one but a lot of employees are getting blackberries for free to use for their business five to guess i'd say that's about 75 of the blackberries that are being used in the us which leaves about 250 000 people who are using blackberries by choice or because they can't afford anything else or they're locked into a contract right now some of these people are really difficult to understand like i could understand if your business forces you to use a blackberry for business and you can't really afford anything else or if you use a second phone for more personal use but if you're one of the maybe 100 or 150 000 people that chooses to use a blackberry over anything else for the price that's confusing to me did you know that in the united states on verizon the blackberry bold 9930 costs the same as the samsung galaxy nexus anyway here's a little graphic i put together a very short one that summarizes the state of research in motion the company that's behind blackberry [Music] i kid i kid rim you're doing all right okay you got a million people that's solid here look i have a blackberry with me right now i promise i don't use any other devices it's just the one that i happen to prefer it's a neat little device it's very pocketable i have this other random phone here don't know how it got here but it it fits in the screen of this other device it's how pocketable it is and it has a keyboard and it has a camera on the back i think that's a one megapixel camera um the screen is about an inch or two maybe that's all you really need is a little keyboard right here you can hear the clicks they're very tactile and stuff and that's what it's all about with blackberries isn't it look at that it's hefty it's the bulk you need either way i'm back to doing regular videos guys in case you haven't noticed i am back from my one week break thanks for watching this video if you enjoyed it feel free to give it a thumbs up as that does help out a lot and subscribing if you want to see more videos uh and of course your comments are going to be answered in the comment section right below that like button so i'll talk to you guys in the next video thanks for watching peace [Music] you"

    ,"[Music] hey what is up guys mkbhp here and well welcome back to techtober the event that we are waiting for just wrapped up which means i'm not allowed to share that my daily driver for the past couple days has been the brand new oneplus 6t so this phone's had a lot of hype leading up to it we started seeing those specs and a little bit of design leaks and basically got a lot of people waiting for this phone so the oneplus 6t is in the purest sense of the word an incremental update most of it is the same as the oneplus 6 that we're already familiar with that i liked a lot and then you could consider this a bit of a design refresh a couple months later so they took the oneplus 6 which is already a pretty solid and well-liked phone and they made some upgrades and some tweaks to things that they felt could be better and they took it up a notch okay there's your notch pun for the video so there are conveniently six new things with the oneplus 6t so first of all the new display it's bigger it's a 6.4 inch display and still your 2340x1080 optic amoled they've been on for a while and it's still pretty great it's bright it's colorful and has a built-in adjustable color profiles obviously i'm a big phone person and phone screens keep getting bigger and i still love it also slightly smaller chin than the oneplus 6 not drastically smaller but you can see it when you put them side by side so the display is definitely an improvement and that brings us to number two as you can see the teardrop notch up here at the top everything oneplus wanted to do with the fairly standard notch on the oneplus 6 they are still doing in the smaller notch on this 6t except for the notification led so up here is the front-facing camera the earpiece and the proximity and ambient light sensors no fancy face id dot projector or depth sensors or anything like that but just a pretty solid basic couple things they can still do their super fast facial recognition with the rgb camera that has its pros and cons and the speaker is slotted way up here at the top but it wasn't doing a whole lot anyway so we're not missing out much by shoving a tiny speaker up there and for a lot of people including me this is an improvement larger screen closer to the bezels and more room up top for notifications and info but you can still hide the notch with software if you want to the only weird feeling i got about it is like how curvy it is just i mean that's quite the curve from left to right if you remember the essential phone that notch had probably about the same volume and total size but it was pretty rectangular on the sides this one is all slopey and then it just it just touches the top of whatever app you're using in the middle it's interesting but you get used to it just like any other notch okay number three is the fingerprint reader underneath the display something again a lot of people were looking forward to happy to see this slowly starting to become more common in mainstream phones so that one plus six couple months ago had the fingerprint reader on the back that's now gone and it's moved the logo up a little bit in its place and you can now unlock your phone by just touching the glass i've left it enabled the entire time i've been using it and i'd say it's it's faster than that first gen from the vivo phone i first tested a couple months ago but uh still slower than the gold standard of like touch id or a lot of the physical fingerprint readers it's just somewhere in between it's not instant but it's just a little beat of you unlocking your phone it's it's getting there you can't really just touch your finger to the screen and then remove it quickly and get to using the phone it'll still tell you you're going too fast but if you leave it there for a beat you're in pretty quick the animation is pretty corny i think and there's two others you can pick from in the software but the thing is they all happen at full brightness that's part of how the tech of this optical fingerprint reader underneath the screen works it involves shining a light on your fingerprint so even though it's an oled and they can keep all the pixels black and the clock is dim to save battery the fingerprint reader when it reads your finger goes to max brightness and at night that can be kind of annoying basically i was hoping there could be an even more subtle animation than the three that were provided also that means that unlocking the phone at night or when it's dark specifically is kind of annoying i know it's definitely nitpicking at this point but think about it i have both face unlock and fingerprint unlock enabled at night when it's dark the face unlock camera which just uses the rgb camera doesn't work very well so you have to use the fingerprint and then when you use the fingerprint it shines that full brightness light that kind of bleeds around your finger into your face which is kind of annoying just i know that's again super minor but this is the kind of stuff you notice when you use a phone every day so i'll mention it number four is the new battery so while the phone is pretty much the same size this is oneplus biggest improvement on paper going from a 3300 to a 3700 milliamp hour battery that has been awesome in practice for the endurance of this phone the six was already pretty good but i'm now getting pretty consistently five plus hours of screen on time one of the days i had nearly six hours with 10 left so it might not be a 4 000 milliamp hour sell like it isn't the biggest number on paper but this improvement thanks to the 1080p oled and pretty clean software has this basically my battery champ this year so far and it still has that incredibly fast fast charging so that is impressive then number five uh it's true the headphone jack is now gone on the 6t even oneplus is getting rid of the headphone jack a moment of silence for its loss so yeah it's 2018 pretty much only samsung and lg are left still riding that headphone jack train and it's kind of interesting coming from a company like oneplus who we know to usually be first to listen to what users want so when i asked them what their reasoning was for not having a headphone jack because i got to ask them directly they said it's the larger battery and the fingerprint reader under the screen both take up so much extra space in this same size phone that they felt it made sense to get rid of the headphone jack so that's their words and the number six new different thing is probably the best news this phone starts at 128 gigs of storage now instead of 64 and for the same exact price as the last one 549 so you get twice as much storage for the same starting price and this whole new design so oneplus is sure sticking to their guns of competitive pricing and then that's it everything else about the oneplus 6t in the software on the surface under the hood materials and build it's all the same as that one plus six same oxygen os on top of android pie with the new gestures and all the new features oneplus has been throwing in same smoothness and a plus performance that i was so happy about a couple months ago that drew me away from the pixel same snapdragon 845 and six or eight gigs of ram so i expect it to continue to be smooth same colors so it's launching with this midnight black or mirror black which means you may still want to toss on a skin from our sponsor dbrand this matrix black they have happens to look pretty damn good and now you won't see nearly as many fingerprints so kind of a win-win there and oneplus still took the shortcuts they took last year so no wireless charging for example even though it's a glass back phone and it's the same exact camera the hardware sensor and lens and everything as the oneplus 6. so you can see photos from last year's phone they are going to start to look better with each round of software updates they're learning a lot from pixel and iphone's hdr techniques and building them in here plus a new night mode is here that does more with longer exposures and dark scenes but of course all these changes are also coming to the exact same oneplus 6 camera since it's just a software change and they kept of course one of the most important things about the six which was a starting price easy recommendation this is a great phone now it's also coming with verizon compatibility and they're gonna start working with t-mobile you'll see it in t-mobile stores i'm assuming so this is going to be making its first big push into carriers in the us which is pretty cool uh yeah there's a lot going for this phone it's continued to impress me even though they got rid of the headphone jack which is a bummer for a lot of people but it's been impressive how much they stick with the fast and smooth mantra through their phones these have been consistently the fastest phones i use for the past couple years which is great and that's a function of how much they care about software so i have no problem recommending oneplus 6t this is just the oneplus 6 in a prettier higher tech package with a bigger battery for the same price can't really go wrong there so that's been it what do you think is this your next phone let me know thanks for watching talk to you guys the next one peace"
    ,"[Music] hey guys in this mkbhd video we're going to be taking a look at episode 2 of youtube tips and yes this episode is about graphics so in this episode i'll just be talking to you guys basically and giving you guys a few uh imagery of the following things that are pretty important to youtube graphics so pardon me if i look to the side which is where my notes are you're going to want to have a logo a channel design or banner if you happen to be a youtube partner a video banner which is above your video your intro which is actually a moving graphic and as an added bonus you can also have a watermark now i actually have been changing around with my watermark a little bit so i just kind of have like a temporary watermark that you guys can check out and leave feedback on but you also might be interested in making all these things in the same sort of color scheme to make it easier to remember so as you can probably already tell all of my graphics are in some sort of form of red black and white and the three colors combined happen to be my favorite colors but those three colors together are pretty important to a consistent color scheme now how exactly do you go about creating these images well there are a number of ways that you can try and a number of ways that you can let other people try my intro was created using a template and using a tutorial from another youtube user i don't even remember where i got it but it took me a couple days to actually put together and it's only five seconds long if you want to hold an intro contest to let other people who are already watching your videos actually try to make an intro for you you can or use other people's tutorials to do so with still graphics like your channel design your video banner or your watermark i really suggest getting getting to know is one of my favorite pieces of software it's free it's an alternative to photoshop cs5 and it's almost as powerful it's a very very powerful piece of software so if you get to know and i think you'll you'll find that that's one of my favorite pieces of software and could be one of yours you can make some really nice graphics now my channel banner and background were both made with photoshop however my video banner my watermark and all the other still graphics on my channel were made with so that goes to show you that it can be pretty powerful so overall in my opinion it might not seem like a big deal to you but i think that when you're just starting out or when you're actually building your brand it can be a really good idea to establish a really solid color scheme that people can remember you by whether it's a blue and white or red and black or some orange and black or something crazy but honestly it's up to you and you can i like i suggested try to get to use and watch some  tutorials there are some really great users out there i'll probably try to link a few up right here that can help you out a lot with if you message them or just watch their videos so this has been mkbhd with quick episode episode two of getting your youtube videos together more professionally and this has been on graphics stay tuned for episode three which should be coming up i'll probably be making these videos once every week or so maybe a week and a half or two weeks they're kind of difficult to make you'd be surprised either way see you next time mkbhd signing out peace [Music]"
    ,"hey what's up guys MKBHD here remember the Google cr-48 Now let me fill you in basically the cr-48 was the first ever Chromebook and it was sort of a test pilot for Google's Chrome OS now you probably already know what Google Chrome is in fact if you're like me you're probably watching this video in Chrome right now but Chrome OS is a little bit different because it's the only thing that you turn on when you turn on the computer so Google Chrome is the entire operating system it's it's just the browser so there's no window Windows no Mac OS 10 no Linux you just turn on the computer and boom Google Chrome turns on that's it now I think and you can give a thumbs up on this video if you agree I think Chrome OS is a little bit ahead of its time it's a little bit too far into the future and it's trying to make its way here in the present and that's why it's not being so successful right now hear me out maybe you'll agree basically everything that's awesome already about Google Chrome as a browser just turns into everything that's awesome about the operating system so the super fast startup times you can open up the laptop and it'll Zoom like nearly instantly it's very secure and it's just really really fast everything just works you even have device sync so it'll sync with the Chrome on your other devices so things like that it just makes it seem like a very complete platform and why not use Chrome I mean Chrome is a really good idea for that so you got to have apps because you can't just live in the browser forever sometimes you need to just get stuff done with applications uh there is a Chrome App Store it's called the Chrome web store so these are turning into things that are Way Beyond just glorified websites or shortcuts so basically sometimes you get an app in the Chrome web store where you click on the icon it just takes you to the website for that app where they're actually turning now into real apps like applications that are running your browser so you click on it and you'll be get this you know beautiful interface that looks nothing like the web app and it's really interesting to use so you can check out the links in the description below for stuff like Chromebooks and the Chrome web store and I'll keep telling you why Chrome OS is so awesome yeah I said Chromebooks because Chrome OS is the operating system itself but it's also being kind of unsuccessful right now because Chrome books aren't selling very well I bet you didn't know you could buy Chromebooks in like your local Best Buy have you even seen one on a shelf I have but I look for them there are Samsung Chromebooks out there there are Asus Chromebooks out there and there's a test pilot which was the c48 and right now they are very low speec machines and this is why Google Drive flies into the picture and really completes the entire package it really makes it an ecosystem kind of almost see these Chromebooks don't need to cost very much because they need to be affordable for people who need a simple computer like that and they also only have to run Google Chrome so they make them you know have an Intel mobile processor maybe an Atom Processor maybe 1 gab of ram a dedicated video card won't be happening in the Chromebooks and you really just have a low spec and you'll have maybe eight maybe 16 GB of internal storage on these Chromebooks it seems like enough when you're only using Google Chrome but then you realize you want to make it like an actual computer so you're going to need you know store your photos store your documents and view you know listen to your music and all that kind of stuff and you're going to need more than 8 gigs Google Drive comes into the picture and suddenly you have 25 gigs of external storage that's just on Google's Cloud servers you don't have to worry about it it's really really cheap and if you need more than that you can pay for more it's a genius system and it's very inexpensive and it's just a great ecosystem with the Chromebooks so overall you're getting Chrome chromeos and Tab sync across multiple platforms you get the Chrome web store you get the Chrome apps you get all these different things that are just kind of revolving around each other and making a great package in a Chromebook and it's just not selling well at all and that's why I think it's ahead of its time people aren't really ready to move fully to the cloud for their laptop computer personally I think an awesome machine would be this something with sort of a MacBook Air form factor running Chrome OS okay having a massive battery and just having maybe 8 gigs of intern internal storage having a massive amount of stuff in Google Drive and large battery uh ultra low voltage processor and have it say Google on the back I don't know I mean it would be pretty sick Chromebook make it maybe matte black or something like that uh and I would definitely like that as a secondary machine now obviously you can't replace your full desktop because you know video editing apps and photo editing Photoshop and things like that can't really be replaced in the cloud completely yet I mean they're getting there but right now I think Chromebooks are a definitely awesome option for a secondary machine and uh it's what I'm using mine for right now either way I just got to thank Lamar Wilson from Wilson Tech 1 because this video would not be possible without him and also all of you guys who have recently subscribed uh who have found my channel thank you welcome aboard and I hope you're enjoying these videos either way thanks for watching leave a thumbs up if you enjoyed it and uh just hit the microphone I'll talk to you guys in the next video thanks for watching guys peace [Music]

    ,"hey what is up guys mkbhd here and i have the samsung galaxy s4 in hand now along with the htc one and the galaxy s4 it's a great phone and all but what i wanted to figure out at least what i was most concerned about when i first got it was you know it's it's just a small sort of evolutionary update to the galaxy s3 it's more incremental uh you could say evolutionary rather than revolutionary so my biggest concern was why did they keep the same design going on are they kind of going the sort of tick-tock strategy that we've seen apple do with the iphone 4 then 4s then 5 and now 5s is that what samsung's doing right now that's what i wanted to know so samsung brought me to new york to check out the galaxy s4 the us variants and a whole bunch of other stuff they had a whole samsung experience shop set up so in those experience shops they had a whole bunch of different devices you can go around and play with the different devices and experiences they had a whole bunch of people waiting in line to get in and once you got in there were devices like the galaxy note 8.0 the galaxy camera the galaxy s4 note 2 a whole bunch of other samsung products like laptops and cases and accessories and things like that it was just full of samsung products so that was pretty neat that they showed us around that but also at the same event i was able to get a hold of and actually interview samsung's ryan biden so he's the director of product marketing for samsung he's basically the reason why you've heard of the galaxy s4 he's a big part of why it was such a successful product you might even remember him from the uh the broadway sort of presentation of the galaxy s4 remember him this guy remember that guy yeah that's ryan biden so i was actually there with a couple of other youtubers including austin from duncan 33303 and soldier knows best but austin interviewed ryan first and he asked pretty much the best set of questions possible and you'll probably see that content on his channel soon enough but he asked basically the exact set of questions that i was going to ask so i just kind of stood up next to him and basically winged it so without any further ado i'll go ahead and show you exactly what happened we played a bit of a word association game with samsung and this is the result all right so i'm going to say a couple of words and you can just tell me the first word or words that come to your mind when i say that okay all right i'll start off easy galaxy uh obviously the galaxy s4 okay um samsung galaxy s4 okay um features uh so there's a few things that come to my mind when you say features um because you've already prompted me to say galaxy s4 it would be features in the galaxy s4 so things like air view and air gestures uh watch on for tv remote control maybe some of the great features of 13 megapixel camera okay um quality quality um so there makes me think about materials and build decisions and technology trade-offs so for example with the galaxy s4 one of the things that some people kind of compare is why have we chosen to go polycarbonate versus aluminum or something like that and it's not a quality decision because those materials are as good as anything else it's about making a device that's thin and light so wanting to make sure that you've got removable battery expandable storage and lots of great stuff so high quality device but still pretty flexible sweet um see i'm out of words already uh let's go with versatile versatile what word comes from i want to say bristol besides the galaxy s4 oh besides galaxy s4 when you say versatile i think of the range of samsung smartphones and devices i mean basically we've got devices at all price points for all people and you know this interview is pretty versatile too so okay uh i saw a tweet like three weeks ago that just had a list of all the screen sizes of samsung devices it went from like 2.8 to i think 10.1 yeah um you guys have 10 inch tablets and you have 4.8 inch or 5 inch now galaxy s4 what's your favorite tablet screen size and why that's a great question so i actually prefer the 10.1s i tend to prefer larger tablets um because i generally roll with both a phone and a tab um basically using something like galaxy s3 or galaxy s4 with 4.8 or 5 inches that's a pretty big screen on the phone so got big screen still really portable so then the next thing piece for me is i want to make sure that i've got enough additional real estate to make it worthwhile carrying that extra device so that's why 10.1 is the tab size for me makes sense all right that's been it thank you so either way that's basically it i figured i would share that little quick fun tidbit with you guys and give it a thumbs up if you enjoyed it uh but now that that has happened and i have the galaxy s4 and the htc one in hand let the mkbhd coverage and comparisons and reviews begin so thumbs up if you're ready for that either way thank you for watching and i'll talk to you guys very soon with that coming up next peace you"
    ,"foreign [Music] [Music] foreign so I got kind of curious with seeing all these videos in my sub box over the past couple months of people getting taken to Chicago to test 5G and doing all these crazy speed tests um but then I started to notice they all sort of have a couple things in common but really it was just getting me curious about the whole thing so I bought a 5G phone and then I drove to the nearest 5G City and I tried it for myself so this is my new 1 600 Samsung Galaxy S10 5G on Verizon and so the crew and I drove from the studio to the nearest 5G city which is Providence Rhode Island so for those unfamiliar a brief explainer what is 5G well we all have 4G now 5G is the fifth generation of wireless network technology and so all the big carriers are working on building out their 5G networks right now Verizon at T Sprint we're all working on 5G the main theme of 5G is again speed every new generation of the wireless networks are significantly faster and more capable than the previous some of you may remember the old and very slow 2G and 3G and how much better 4G is than those 5G represents another step forward so to take advantage of 5G you need a 5G device with 5G radios and a 5G Network so for me that's the Galaxy S10 5G and it's Verizon who's building up their 5G Network in certain cities one location at a time so you can't just get a software update to a 4G phone to just enable 5G that's right I'm talking to you at T changing people's status bars to say 5ge when it's really just 4G it's stupid it's basically a lie you're kind of trying to trick people into thinking they got 5G 5ge is not 5G it's still 4G it's really a shame anyway 5G is built on what's called millimeter waves it's a new section of very high frequency spectrum upwards of 20 gigahertz all the way to near 96 gigahertz but the catch is the higher the frequency of any wave the lesser the range like that's just the truth on paper so for the same reason 5 gigahertz Wi-Fi doesn't travel as far as 2.4 gigahertz Wi-Fi the same reason microwaves don't cook things on the other side of the glass wall that's the same reason 5G doesn't travel as well through the real world so millimeter waves biggest problem is that even if you're standing pretty close to the node like a couple hundred feet away it only really travels well within direct line of sight so things like trees and walls and buildings block and disrupt The High Frequency signal even if you're still close to it I've heard even that rain in the air could potentially be a problem so this is why I wanted to test this for myself so we drove to Providence Rhode Island which is on the growing list of Verizon's 5G cities it's not the whole city that's one big 5G hotbed it's only certain areas sort of tucked away happens to be near Brown University where we found one of them and we found it by finding one of these this is a 5G node or three nodes to be specific at the top of a light pole you could tell because it said Verizon right on the pole and because if you stand right next to it with a 5G phone in your hand and run a speed test the results are just absolutely ridiculous the 4G and the notification bar switches to indicate 5G and you open up your app of choice and run a speed test and I'm seeing easy 700 800 900 often well above a thousand megabits per second download highest result I actually saw in my personal testing was 1.9 gigabits per second briefly from fast.com that's just that's that's just hilariously fast like you could almost use your whole data cap in a minute um dream like speeds very very nice of course you want to see what this type of speed is actually good for other than a speed test so YouTube videos just played instantly without any buffering in HD I could fast forward right off the bat no problem web browsing of course would be super fast hopping into the Play Store to download a gigantic game like pubg mobile progress moves pretty fast not like a blink of an eye and it's done but still miles better than it would be on LTE the fortnite downloader progressed faster than the fortnite installer would have meaning it's it's crazy impressive and downloading an entire Stranger Things episode from Netflix in HD on this phone took about four seconds so you could grab a whole season in probably like 30 seconds if you wanted to which is again absolutely ideal but again here's the thing this is all while standing like right next to the Tower with a direct line of sight you know perfectly ideal conditions great weather once I left that it kind of broke down pretty quickly so right around the corner of this brick building just to get into the shade so literally maybe 75 feet away from the node but behind a wall I'm getting much slower 5G it's still 5G but you can see the numbers here now I mean it's kind of crazy to call 200 300 400 down slow but compared to what I was getting before that's a pretty big difference to basically cut your speed in half just by walking a couple meters down the block and also notice just by walking halfway down the block I'd start bouncing back and forth between 4G and 5G and like it was frustratingly inconsistent even when I did have a line of sight with maybe a tree or two sort of nearby my phone would drop 5G and then jump back on again and you can see it in the notification bar it would drop back to 5G and then back to 4G and then when I was on 5G and I ran the speed test it would be great I get a thousand down again which is awesome but when I ran it at 4G I would get 4G speeds and it's really good 4G speeds but it was just weird getting those results back to back like half a block away and when I waited a minute I'd suddenly get 5G again and get a thousand down so what's the solution for this well as we understand it basically just putting a lot of nodes all over the place so essentially to maximize coverage and improve technology so that when you move behind one obstacle or sort of drive through a city you actively switch between nodes that you can connected to kind of like we do now with 4G towers but just much faster and I think that's the part that kind of scares people it seems Seems like a Brute Force way to actually go about fixing the problem but that's the current plan is to just blanket areas with these lower powered cells that let you switch between them very very quickly instead of one giant 4G Tower like you have now my gut feeling is that an infrastructure where you cover an entire city and eventually an entire country in these little nodes is going to be incredibly expensive and probably take a very long time like years so it's a long way off but here's another thing to notice even with me standing right next to a 5G node and holding a brand new 2019 5G phone there were still some drawbacks to notice the main three are heat battery and upload so for one the upload appears to still be happening at 4G speed even when I'm connected to 5G I never broke 100 megabits per second up in all my testing which is still a great speed but my dream of uploading an 8K YouTube video in like five seconds or going live streaming high resolution VR or something like that are not possible at all yet now you've probably also noticed the Ping is still at 4G levels too the goal is to get this down to a millisecond or less but that isn't happening yet in these tests either and then heat and Battery are something that this phone seemed to specifically suffer from when I was testing I started my day when we got to Providence with 75 Battery did all my testing and that maybe took about four or five hours and when we finished I was at 21 battery and the phone was warm to the touch the whole time this is why you see 5G versions of phones coming out almost always have a larger battery than their normal 4G Brothers including the Galaxy S10 5G and the phone getting warm during the testing too when I wasn't even gaming or doing anything graphically intensive just watching some YouTube videos and download tests was a little concerning so the bottom line 5G is like folding phones right now in 2019 clearly not ready yet but when you use it and you get just the right use case and you're at just the right space you get this amazing little glimpse into the future that you wish was ready for right now because it's so great but it's not and currently the cons sort of outweigh the pros and I wouldn't spend extra money on it right now in 2019. the future of 5G is really bright assuming you know the infrastructure happens and isn't too obtrusive and that's a big assumption but then we're talking virtual reality streaming and networks of autonomous cars that are all internet connected and talking to each other and maybe even think about remote surgery with a 5G connected robot in one country with a doctor over here and a patient in another country and everything just working seamlessly like all this super high bandwidth low latency stuff maybe the end of video buffering altogether all seem possible but as of right now in 2019 it just isn't ready yet but I'm super ready for when it is either way thanks for watching catch you guys in the next one peace big thanks to nordvpn for sponsoring this video so what is a VPN a virtual private Network secures your internet traffic encrypts it and routes it through a remote

    ,"hey guys it's mkbhd back with an hd video and today we're going to be taking a look at the blue yeti pro and just a heads up i recently did a collab video with product feedback so you can check that out right here basically one thing you should know about this mic right away is it is absolutely massive you're going to want to leave room on your desk for this puppy it measures in at about a foot tall and about four inches wide anyway just like the original yeti this mic comes with the stand you see here which a lot of other companies fail to include so good job blue you can see it's pretty versatile stand as well and you can take it off the stand and use it with an arm like i will be and just so you know the base is weighted nicely so it won't be sliding around but like some other things in life you gotta bend it over and look at the back side the most important part and this is actually where the most important part of the microphone is this is where you can determine what kind of sound quality you get out of the yeti pro so starting on the left there's a usb port to connect it to your computer they provide that cable on the top is an analog stereo xlr connection and they also provide that xlr cable on the right hand side is a pretty cool feature it's a no latency headphone jack for listening to your recordings live and the bottom holes for your microphone stand on the front of the yeti pro here you have your controls for that latency free headphone jack so you can listen to yourself louder or softer or mute the mic all together i don't know something about the solid feel of the yeti pro i just really like pushing our buttons um anyway on that curvy backside again we have controls for all the mic patterns so this is where you can switch between stereo cardioid bi-directional and omnidirectional patterns and this is all thanks to the triple condenser mic array inside and it's these mics that record 24 bit 192 kilohertz stereo audio that's four times cd quality audio giggity so i'm sure you're dying to take a listen so without any further ado let's switch from this editor's case sl 150 to the yeti pro all right now we're listening to is a standard recording from the yeti pro microphone the gain is about medium recording at 192 kilohertz and 24-bit stereo sound in the cardioid pattern with the gain about medium as you can hear the audio quality is really quite good very good in the cardioid pattern for things like vocals and voiceovers like we're doing now if you do record at such a high bit rate the file size tends to be pretty high so if you don't need such high quality vocals you can turn that down but of course if you're buying the blue yeti pro it's such an investment that you might as well get the most out of it so i can highly recommend this microphone based on the sound that i'm getting out of it as you can see in the background i have used the editor's keys sl150 for quite a few of my videos and i really like it but the sound quality of the triple capsule pattern within the yeti pro is really really impressive so that's pretty much it for the sound quality and if you like this video go ahead and make sure you give it a thumbs up this is basically uh it's you know overall review of the microphone as i've had it for a little bit so thanks for watching this video guys and i'll talk to you guys later peace [Music] you"

    ,"hey what's up guys I'm kay PhD here as you probably already have seen this project from Google rooms recently made public called Google glass has gotten a lot of buzz in the last couple of hours really I slept on it and I thought about it and I think it's about time we take a little bit of a deeper analysis in this sort of augmented reality thing so let's take a look at these Google glasses by the way if I sound like I'm sick because I'm sick so let's first start off with the video that Google Pao for them looks like the guy woke up and he was already wearing his jeans and his Google glasses but that's cool cuz I'd probably sleep in my glasses too if i was a beta tester anyway he's going along with his day and then he gets this notification that pops up in the corner and then he is somehow able to bring this notification into focus and then do some actions with it before he releases it now when I see this I'm really really hoping that there's a way to be able to choose when the notification goes from the corner to the main focus because if you're doing something important like oh I don't know driving a car how you might want to be able to leave that notification in the corner for a while until you're not busy anymore so I'd like to know if you like there's some I guess ters that are going on if this guy's like tapping his forehead or if he's nodding or something something to get the notification to be in your control very very important anyway he uses Google Maps he navigates to this bookstore he walks into the bookstore he's waiting for his friend there and as he walks in he opens up this dialog and says out loud to nobody in the store where's the music section now if you thought people looked ridiculous wearing Bluetooth headsets and talking to nobody at least you could tell like there was something on their ear you noticed after a while with this Google glass it's kind of just like someone walking up to you saying something to nobody nodding in approval and walking away I don't know it just seems a little bit it's the next level of that Bluetooth thing I don't know what its gonna look like but I'm definitely interested to see how it works anyway what I liked about this video were the tons of Google services that I saw that are already on Android like Google Calendar like Google notifications with latitude and navigation through Google Maps and photo sharing through Google+ you know instantly being able to take a picture that's really cool and I like that what I don't know and if I don't know if I'm gonna like or not is how you actually control these things you know if you're blinking incessantly or if you're nodding your head from side to side looking like a crazy person I don't know leave a thumbs up if you want me to try to get like beta testing hands on these I don't know how it's gonna work maybe it's gonna be like a Chromebook pilot program but I really really really want to be one of the first people to use this also Google glass will probably not be the final name it's the name of the project that Google unveiled but it's also still on sort of a super alpha testing apparently I was trying to think of other names for it maybe Google Goggles I mean that's already a product but that also doesn't really resonate well with the Android or the average Joe Google Goggles like no one wants goggles but I figured Google I sounds kind of cool I don't know leaders so if you have a comment if you think there's a better name out there for it leave it in the comments section below on this YouTube video other than that yeah augmented reality is definitely a future and Google putting ads in it is also definitely the future hopefully not obtrusive ads but like we've seen Google it makes a lot of money from ads and it'll be interesting to see where they take it from here either way thanks for watching this video stay tuned for a very special video coming up this Sunday so if you're not already subscribed you're gonna want to do that and I'll talk to you guys the next video thanks for watching peace [Music] you"
